# WIP CC:Tweaked library for Mekanism
Classes and utilities for use when working with [Mekanism](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mekanism) machines

# Install
libmek comes in two flavors:

## Full
Retains whitespace and in-source typing annotation comments that 3rd party IDEs/editors can leverage

Downloads the full variant of the script and saves it as `libmek.lua` in the current working directory
```
pastebin run bnB5nPMr
```

## Minified
Removes needless whitespace and comments and shortens internal variables to reduce overall file size

Downloads the minified variant of the script and saves it as `libmek.lua` in the current working directory
```
pastebin run bnB5nPMr min
```

# Usage
```
local libmek = require('libmek');
-- use library
```
