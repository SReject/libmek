# WIP CC:Tweaked library for Mekanism
Classes and utilities for use when working with [Mekanism](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mekanism) machines

# Install
libmek comes in two flavors:

- Full: Contains code-doc comments that 3rd party IDEs/editors can leverage
- Minified: Removes comments and shortens internal variables to reduce overall file size

## Full
Downloads the full variant of the script and saves it as `libmek.lua` in the current working directory
```
pastebin run bnB5nPMr
```

## Minified
Downloads the minified variant of the script and saves it as `libmek.lua` in the current working directory
```
pastebin run bnB5nPMr min
```

## Usage
```
local libmek = require('libmek');
-- use library
```
